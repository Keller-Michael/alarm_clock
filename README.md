# :alarm_clock: Alarm clock example in ABAP

Little example of an alarm clock implemented in ABAP on Business Technology Platform. Very handy to demonstrate ABAP Unit and topics such as interfaces and dependency injection. First shown at the [ABAPConf 2021](https://www.abapconf.org/) in my talk about "Clean ABAP".
